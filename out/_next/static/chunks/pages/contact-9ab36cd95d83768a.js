You need to have an OpenAI account and a valid API key to use ChatGPT. We don't sell API keys."},{question:"How does this app work?",answer:"This is a static web app, it doesn't have any backend server. When you enter your API key, it will be stored locally and securely on your browser. All API requests are sent directly from your browser to OpenAI server to interact with ChatGPT. Think of this as a HTTP client for your ChatGPT API with a lot of convenience features."},{question:"How is the API key handled?",answer:"Your API is safe and stored locally on your device. This is a static app, which means that it doesn't have a backend. All the data is stored in your browser's local storage.

Does OpenAI allow this use case?",answer:"Yes. TypingMind only stores your API Key locally and never sends your API Key anywhere. OpenAI allows use cases where the API key is stored locally in the user's device. You can see this official response from OpenAI's staff here: https://community.openai.com/t/openais-bring-your-own-key-policy/14538/4"},{question:"Is my API Key encrypted in local storage?",answer:'TypingMind offers additional encryption for your API Key. You can enable encryption with a password by clicking the "OpenAI API Key" button in the sidebar and selecting "Encrypt API key...". Your API Key will be encrypted using the AES algorithm provided by the open-source CryptoJS library (https://github.com/brix/crypto-js). TypingMind only provides an encryption feature for your API key. Chat messages, prompts, AI characters, and other elements are stored using the standard local storage of your browser, which may or may not include encryption, depending on your browser. The encryption process are done entirely locally on your device, there is no backend server. If you use TypingMind on multiple devices, you will need to encrypt your API key on all of them, you can also set different passwords on different devices.'},{question:"What's the difference between ChatGPT Plus and ChatGPT API via TypingMind?",answer:"Under the hood, ChatGPT Plus and ChatGPT API offer the same model and the same quality. You can view this on their official announcement here: https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/chat. The initial system instruction can be a little bit different, which can be configured to make the AI output different messages from time to time."},{question:"I have ChatGPT Plus, will it cost me more to use ChatGPT API via TypingMind?",answer:"The ChatGPT API costs soooooo little you won't even notice it. Typical chat conversation is about 1000 characters, which costs ~$0.001. That's less than a cent. You can have thousands of chats and it will only costs you like $1. See official pricing here: https://openai.com/pricing#language-models"},{question:"How many chats can I have?",answer:"You can have as many chats as you want. The only limit is your OpenAI API key's limit and your browser storage limit (technical term: Local Storage). Web browser gives you some limited data storage, the actual limit is different for each browser. Typically, you can save thousands of chat conversations without problems, but that's not guaranteed. When the browser storage runs out, you will need to delete old chats to save the new ones. We will provide a separate service to sync and backup your chats soon. Adding the website to your home screen may increase the storage capacity."},{question:"How can I sync my chat conversations across devices?",answer:"At the moment, you have to export the chats and import it on another device."},{question:"Is it really faster than ChatGPT?",answer:"Most likely yes. From previous testings and user feedback, it is faster than the default ChatGPT in most cases, especially on long responses. Displaying the whole response instead of showing it word by word also help you to scan the response faster with your eyes. With all that said, the speed improvement is not guaranteed, your actual speed experience may varies (internet connection, API availability, etc.). Give it a try to see for yourself!"},{question:"Why does sometimes TypingMind responds differently than the default OpenAI's ChatGPT event with the same prompt?",answer:"TypingMind uses the same underlying model as OpenAI's default chat app. For the same prompt, it can produce different responses each time. The default chat app by OpenAI may also have some initial prompt settings that are different from TypingMind. If you don't get the response you expects, try \"Re-generate Response\" or tweaking the prompt."},{question:"Can I self-host it?",answer:"Yes.

If you need to use it on for more devices, you can buy a new license keys or add more devices to your existing license key. "Device" is counted based on the number of places where the license key is entered and the chat history is saved for continuous use. For example, if you use Typing Mind on Chrome browser on your laptop and also on your phone, that will be 2 devices. Note that the license key and chat history is saved locally per browser, so if you use Typing Mind on Chrome and also on Firefox, you will need to enter the license key 2 times, have 2 separate chat histories, and that counts as 2 devices. If you need to use the license key on a new device but have reached the device limit, you can unlink the previous devices first using the License Manager (this is done online, access to the previous devices not needed). This device limit is put in place to avoid license key abuse and pirate.'},{question:"How do I remove a device from my license?
