best to answer the user very carefully.\n\nYou have access to the following tools, you must use these tools to help answer the user questions as accurate as possible.\n\nTool list:\n\n---\nSearch:\n- Tool ID: Search\n- Description: search for information from the internet in real-time using Google Search.\n- Usage: when the user ask something that you don\'t know or not able to answer, but you think can be looked up from the internet, you will use this tool to find the answer and respond to the user. Always include the source URL if you respond with the information from the search result.\n- Input: text input containing the query, input must be strictly one line. Make sure use use a search query that most likely return the relevant results from Google Search.\n- Output: the query result from the internet containing title, snippet, and URL.\n---\n\nWhen having a conversation with the user, if you need to use any tool, say the exactly the following command structure in JSON (don\'t include the double curly brackets):\n\n    >⏵ {{ID of the tool you want to use}}:\n    {{your input here}}\n\nExample Search command\n\n    >⏵ Search:\n    what\'s the current gold price\n\nAfter you send the command, you will receive a respond with the following format:\n\n    <<<<<<\n    {{the output from the tool}}\n\nExample response:\n\n    <<<<<<\n    2\n\nRules:\n- If you need to run a command, run it immediately, don\'t ask the user to wait or confirm, don\'t say "let me check", just run the command.\n- You can only search one thing at a time. Do not search multiple things at the same time.\n- After you receive the output string, you will use the output to decide whether to answer the user immediately, or use another tool if needed.\n\nHere are some tips to get more accurate information using the "Search" command:\n- When using the Search command, avoid query that are too specific. Instead, try some keywords that are more likely to return a good result on Google Search, and then follow up with more searches to find the final answer. For example, instead of searching for "what are people talking about typingmind.com on hackernews", which is too specific, try searching for "typingmind.com on hackernews".\n\nCurrent date: {{current_date}}\n'.replace("{{current_date}}",r)},I=e=>{let t=e.split(" ").length;return Math.round(1.33*t)}},82488:function(){},62136:function(e,t,a){"use strict";a.r(t),a.d(t,{CompactEncrypt:function(){return tm},CompactSign:function(){return tw},EmbeddedJWK:function(){return tx},EncryptJWT:function(){return tI},FlattenedEncrypt:function(){return e6},FlattenedSign:function(){return tg},GeneralEncrypt:function(){return e3},GeneralSign:function(){return tv},SignJWT:function(){return tA},UnsecuredJWT:function(){return tW},base64url:function(){return r},calculateJwkThumbprint:function(){return tE},calculateJwkThumbprintUri:function(){return tS},compactDecrypt:function(){return eX},compactVerify:function(){return ta},createLocalJWKSet:function(){return tT},createRemoteJWKSet:function(){return tK},decodeJwt:function(){return tO},decodeProtectedHeader:function(){return tq},errors:function(){return o},exportJWK:function(){return e2},exportPKCS8:function(){return e0},exportSPKI:function(){return e1},flattenedDecrypt:function(){return eV},flattenedVerify:function(){return tt},generalDecrypt:function(){return eZ},generalVerify:function(){return to},generateKeyPair:function(){return tF},generateSecret:function(){return tN},importJWK:function(){return eq},importPKCS8:function(){return eJ},importSPKI:function(){return eW},importX509:function(){return eR},jwtDecrypt:function(){return th},jwtVerify:function(){return tp}});var o={};a.r(o),a.d(o,{JOSEAlgNotAllowed:function(){return k},JOSEError:function(){return b},JOSENotSupported:function(){return E},JWEDecryptionFailed:function(){return S},JWEInvalid:function(){return x},JWKInvalid:function(){return _},JWKSInvalid:function(){return P},JWKSMultipleMatchingKeys:function(){return D},JWKSNoMatchingKey:function(){return T},JWKSTimeout:function(){return M},JWSInvalid:function(){return C},JWSSignatureVerificationFailed:function(){return K},JWTClaimValidationFailed:function(){return A},JWTExpired:function(){return I},JWTInvalid:function(){return H}});var r={};a.r(r),a.d(r,{decode:function(){return tJ},encode:function(){return tR}});var i=crypto;let n=e=>e instanceof CryptoKey,s=async(e,t)=>{let a=`SHA-${e.slice(-3)}`;return new Uint8Array(await i.subtle.digest(a,t))},c=new TextEncoder,l=new TextDecoder;function u(...e){let t=e.reduce((e,{length:t})=>e+t,0),a=new Uint8Array(t),o=0;return e.forEach(e=>{a.set(e,o),o+=e.length}),a}function d(e,t,a){if(t<0||t>=4294967296)throw RangeError(`value must be >= 0 and <= ${4294967296-1}.
