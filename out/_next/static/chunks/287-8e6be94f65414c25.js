To increase the messages limit per month, please contact us."},{question:"How many messages my users can send on my chat instance?",answer:"The default subscription comes with 100,000 messages per month per instance.

If you reach this limit, please contact us."},{question:'What is a "Chat instance" or an "instance"?',answer:'A "Chat instance" or an "instance" is a chat interface you created when sign up for a Custom Deployment on TypingMind. You can create multiple chat instances for multiple purposes. Each Chat instance is tied to one OpenAI key and run on one domain.'},{question:"Do I need an OpenAI API key to use this?",answer:"Yes. After you create a Chat instance, you will need to add the OpenAI API Key in your admin panel. Otherwise, your users cannot chat."},{question:"Do my users need an OpenAI API key to use my chat instance?",answer:"No. Your users do not need an OpenAI API key to use your chat instance."},{question:"How is my API key handled?",answer:"Your API key is stored securely in our database and is not shared with anyone.

Stay tuned!"},{question:"What are the features my users can use in the chat interface?",answer:"Your chat interface will have exactly the same features as on TypingMind.com. Updates, new features, and bug fixes on TypingMind.com are also available on your chat instance at the same time. "},{question:"Can I charge my users to use my chat instance? Can I offer this exclusively to my paying members only?",answer:"Yes you can, however, at the moment you'll need to manage the user payments by yourself. You will also need to add your users manually via the Admin Panel. We'll look into making this easier soon."},{question:"Where are the chats saved?",answer:"The chats for each user are saved locally on their devices. As an Admin, you can enable chat logging (at and additional cost) that will allow you to view your users' chat messages. Note that the users will be informed that their chats are saved and can be viewed by you (the Admin)."},{question:"How to train the chat interface with my own data?",answer:'Currently this is not possible, but in the future, you can do this by customizing the default system instruction to give your chat interface a "default context". Note that this will consume more of your token for every message. Manage your token usage wisely.'},{question:"Can I train the model with my own data from PDF, DOCX, internal docs, etc.?",answer:"Yes.

Keep in mind that you'll have to pay for your own OpenAI API usage, the more token used, the more costy it will get. In the future, we will look into utilizing ChatGPT Plugins to enable even more tranining data and knowledge-base based Q&A."},{question:"Can I track which users use the most token from my OpenAI API key?",answer:"Yes, but not yet. We're working on this and will be available soon. Stay tuned!"},{question:"Can my users use ChatGPT Plugins in the chat instance?",answer:"Not yet, as ChatGPT plugins are not supported in the API. But once OpenAI makes it possible, we'll integrate it in right away."},{question:"I've already bought the Team License (10 Users) or the Team License (50 users) on TypingMind.com. Can I use it on my Custom Deployment?",answer:"Yes. We allow you to convert your Team License to the Custom Deployment version with the same amount of users.

To convert your Team License, please contact us at support@typingmind.com."},{question:"What's the different between Custom Deployment, Self-host static app, and the Custom Branding?",answer:"The main different is that in the Custom Deployment, your users don't need to enter an OpenAI API Key and License Key, their chats will use your API key and you will pay for your users' usage. In the self-host static app (and the custom branding addon), you simply host a 1:1 copy of TypingMind, and your users still have to buy/enter a License Key on their own."},{question:"Is the system prompt going to be visible to users?",answer:"By default, yes. But you can hide it from the users and use your own default system propmt.

Fine-tune models are not yet supported."},{question:"I already have the self-host static app. Can I use it with my Custom Deployment?",answer:"No, the self-host static app that comes for free when you buy a license is not intended to be used by team. You can still allow your team members to use it but they'll need to enter their License Key and API Key. With the Custom Deployment, your team members do not have to have a license key and API key to use it."},{question:"Can I allow my users to login via 3rd party services (Google, Facebook, etc.), SSO, or my own OAuth system?",answer:"Currently, that's not possible.

That's doable by customizing the default system instruction and hide it from the users. This feature will be available soon."},{question:"Can I change the user interface to another language (Spanish, French, etc.)?",answer:"That's not possible at the moment, but we're looking to add it in soon."},{question:"Where can I find the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy?",answer:"Terms of Service: https://typingmind.com/terms#custom-deployment ; Privacy Policy: https://typingmind.com/privacy#custom-deployment"},{question:"The FAQ Bot is awesome!
